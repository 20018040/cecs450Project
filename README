Each variable provides important insights into the honey production industry.
Here's a brief overview of what each variable represents:

numcol (Number of Honey Producing Colonies):
    This measures the maximum number of bee colonies that were used for honey production during the year.
    It includes colonies from which honey was harvested, even if they did not survive the entire year.

yieldpercol (Honey Yield Per Colony):
    This indicates the average amount of honey, in pounds, produced by each colony.

totalprod (Total Production):
    Calculated as numcol multiplied by yieldpercol, this represents the total honey production in pounds.

stocks (Stocks Held by Producers):
    This refers to the quantity of honey, in pounds, that is held in inventory by producers.

priceperlb (Average Price Per Pound):
    This is the average market price per pound of honey, calculated based on expanded sales.
    It's a reflection of the market value of honey.

prodvalue (Value of Production):
    This is the total monetary value of the honey production, calculated as totalprod multiplied
    by priceperlb. It represents the total revenue generated from honey production.

Each of these variables is crucial for understanding different aspects of the
honey production industry, such as productivity, market dynamics, and economic value.
